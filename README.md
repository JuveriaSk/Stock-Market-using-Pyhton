# Stock-Prediction-using-Pyhton
In this project, I delve into the realm of finance, specifically analyzing data from tech giants such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.

## Project Highlights:

#### Data Retrieval:
I kickstart the project by collecting stock market data directly from Yahoo Finance using Python, showcasing the robust capabilities of Python for data acquisition.

#### Data Cleaning:
A pivotal step, where I ensure that the analysis is based on clean, reliable, and accurate data by tackling the  missing data, eliminating duplicates, and tiding up the dataset.

#### Historical Stock Price Analysis: 
Delving into how stock prices, particularly Amazon's, have evolved over time. This segment is where I apply the programming skills to real financial data.

#### Stock Volume Insights: 
Here I leverage the potential of data visualization to reveal patterns and trends as we graphically represent the trading volumes over time.

#### Moving Average Trends: 
Calculating and analyzing moving averages to gain insights into stock trends. Here, we can see how the technical analysis meets data science.

#### Daily Returns Analysis: 
Calculating and assessing the daily returns of each stock, providing a deep dive into volatility and risk.

#### Trend Analysis: 
Introducing a new column, 'Trend,' to categorize stock performance based on daily returns. We explore how this trend data informs decision-making.

#### Visualizing Trends: 
Leveraging data visualization techniques with a Pie Charts to visually represent the frequency of stock price trends.

#### Correlation Exploration: 
Investigating the correlation between daily returns of different stocks. This step involves statistical analysis and data interpretation.


As a data analytics enthusiast this project provides a practical opportunity has helped me to apply my data cleaning and visualization skills to real-world scenario like finance sector. Upon completion of this project I have gained profound understanding of stock market analysis.
